DATA ANALYST INTERNSHIP TASK 3

“Interactive Power BI dashboard turning raw Amazon sales data into clear, actionable business insights.”

I transformed the raw Amazon sales dataset from Excel into an interactive Power BI dashboard. Using Power Query, I cleaned and prepared the data by removing unnecessary 
columns, fixing data types, and creating calculated fields like Sales and Profit. I then designed visuals, added slicers for interactivity, and applied a consistent theme
to deliver clear, actionable insights.
